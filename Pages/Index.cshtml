        <p> My purpose in creating this website was threefold: </p>

        <p>
            First, I wanted some sort of motivating project to work on that would allow me to improve my C# coding skills.
            Unfortunately, the C# necessary for building this website so far has been minimal and basic, but luckily the
            website has given me a wide variety of other beautiful and complicated problems to solve. I have had to learn
            HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Razor Pages, database creation, and probably more stuff I can’t think of.
            Really fascinating stuff and I am extremely satisfied with the path I ended up going through.
        </p>
        <p>
            Second, I have a deep desire to hone my writing skills because I’m really not impressed with my current output.
            I figured making a blog is one of the best ways to do that because putting content out there for the world to see is
            a powerful motivator to create the quality material. Please, heavily critique both writing style/ grammar and the
            actual content anywhere on this website.
        </p>
        <p>
            Third, I thought it would be fun to have an easily accessible place to store and share things that I care about.
            That’s how the Book and Knowledge-Repo pages came to be. The book page will give me the ability to keep track of my
            reading while providing reviews and commentary to future self and others. The Knowledge repository is intended to
            just be a storehouse for any sources of information that are useful or cool. At some point after it’s large enough
            I would like to organize it into broad categories with the ability to drill down further at your pleasure.
        </p>

                Need to figure out how to make the pictures turn out better. I resized them with CSS to make them all the same size, but
                that makes some weird distortions for certain pictures.
