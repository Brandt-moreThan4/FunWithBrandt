<h1>Graphs</h1>

<br /><br />

<p>I think the vision for this page is going to be a dashboard of sorts with various graphs that are scaped from different websites. 
    Similar to below except smaller and a lot more. The scraping and plotting will likely be done in Python so I'll need to figure out how
     to execute python code here.</p>
