If you know with 100% certainty that a security is undervalued should you put all your money into it?
I think not. When you say "undervalued" you are saying that given this security's cash flows and the uncertainty of these cash flows its value should be X, but it currently trading for X - Y. Where Y is the dollar amount of the mispricing. At first past you may think that this is an arbitrage opportunity of sorts and it typically is presented as such, but the only way this is arbitrage is if after buying at (X-Y) you could immediately sell for X. Then you may think that since your valuation is correct with 100% accuracy that eventually the mispricing will be corrected and that you will make your profit. This reasoning calls to mind Keynes famous quote "The market can remain irrational for longer than you can remain solvent." Or the familiar phrase that "Being too early is indistinguishable from being wrong." Both quotes make clear the possible complications of your investment. To try to be a little more concrete it is helpful to think a little more specifically. Even if your valuation at time T is correct if that mispricing does not occur by time T+1 and you must sell at T+1 then you are screwed. Another possibility is that at time T+1 the valuation has changed just because of the uncertainty of life. The security may now be correctly valued by you at X-Z where Z>Y. In this case your valuation is now lower than the market value! To make it worse imagine the market now realizes its mistake and values the security at the correct value of X-Z. In this case even though you were 100% correct you were still screwed. Diversification is paramount to investment success. The only way to assure your success would be if you can bet on hundreds of these mispricing's so that the variance washed out and your average profit is in fact (X-Y).
