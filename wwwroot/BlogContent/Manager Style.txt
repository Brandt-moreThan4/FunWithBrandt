Are small sized money managers preferred over big? Sector specific or broad? Probably the commonsense view on this matter is that a sector specific fund would be preferred to one that juggles a wide variety of investment opportunities. This view follows straightforward from the idea that if they spend all their time analyzing a narrow topic then the expertise they will develop in that area will be extreme allowing them to generate alpha. Make sense obviously, but I do tend to lean towards the views of the generalist than specialist.Being a generalist can usually give you unique insight into specific areas because you are able to access a more diverse set of mental models based on your eclectic knowledge base. I would also think that being a specialist can make you a bit myopic to new points of view and you may get bogged down in the details while losing focus on the broader perspective
