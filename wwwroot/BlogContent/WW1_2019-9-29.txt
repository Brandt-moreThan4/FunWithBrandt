I think of the most fascinating things is the tacit cooperation of enemies in trench warfare in WW1. I am fuzzy on the details, but I believe the gist of the encounters would involve some sort of signal detectable by foot soldiers, but not superior officers, to alert troops of the opposing side that a temporary truce was being proposed. An example would be if a French sharpshooter would unload a few well-aimed shots on some object nearby to German soldiers to suggest that the sniper has the ability, but not the desire to take their life. In return a German sharpshooter could return the favor by also firing off a few well-placed shots on an object near the French position. Word would get around to foot soldiers that a truce has been established and for a time after that all soldiers would fight on to prevent the wrath of commanding officers but shoot poorly aimed shots with no intent to kill.
