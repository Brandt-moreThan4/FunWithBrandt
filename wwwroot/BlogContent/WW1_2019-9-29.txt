Reading the book "Behave" by Robert Sapolsky I came across a fascinating story. I am really fuzzy on the actual details, but the gist of it involves the tacit cooperation of enemies during trench warfare in WW1. 
This cooperation consisted of agreements made by foot soldiers on opposing sides, under the noses of superior officers, for a period of pretend fighting. An example of such a truce would be if a French Sharpshooter unloaded a few well-aimed shots on some object conspicuously nearby to German soldiers to suggest that the sniper has the ability, but not the desire to take their life. In return a German sharpshooter could repay the gesture by also firing a few well-placed shots on an object near French soldiers. After this encounter word would spread amongst the foot soldiers that a truce has been established, leading to a period of lackluster effort and poorly aimed shots. This would continue until superior officer caught on and set things straight.
