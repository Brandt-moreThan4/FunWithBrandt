To briefly touch on yesterday's issue, assuming that you should not invest all of your money into that one mispriced security how much money should you invest?
Probably the easiest way to think about it for me, at least initially, would be to use a standard mean-variance framework. Essentially you do all the normal stuff: using data on expected returns, variances, and covariances you construct a portfolio with the highest possible sharp ratio and invest in that portfolio however much your risk preferences dictate. The only real change needed to the framework is that you adjust the expected return on the mispriced security to account for the mispricing. Would you adjust the variance and covariance estimates? I don't know. Obviously, the implementation of this would be trickier and there are surely nuances that I am ignoring in this quick solution, but I think this is probably a decent way to at least begin to think of how much to allocate in your portfolio. Only problem is that it doesn't have a "feel-good" intuition to back it up really, but that tends to be the case using any methodology that isn't strictly fundamental/ story driven.
